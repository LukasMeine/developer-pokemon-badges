# Developer Pokemon badges
_Proudly display your hard-earned badges to the world_

## Motivation
As developers, we collect some badges along our journey. Be them certifications, course completions, or anything else shiny that looks nice on our resumes.

I had this idea when I came across [this post on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/23bhni/took_a_screenshot_of_garys_badges_from_pok%C3%A9mon), where the Redditor did an amazing job vectoring a classic scene from Pokemon, where Gary tries to act cool by boasting his gym badges.

I removed the original gym badges, leaving only the background, and created a simple front end where you can add up to three badges of your own. Then, you can export the result either as svg or png and add the result to your GitHub profile


## Contributing

This was a super quick vacation project. The code sucks and it would be nice to support more badges. I am super open to contributions from the community
